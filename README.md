# Maven Healthcare Challenge
This project is my submission for the [Maven Healthcare Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-healthcare-challenge/26). My goal is to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data and determine if it was able to improve quality of care and service to patients. 

## Overview
▪ Exploratory data analysis: initial dataset review and cleaning; identify and address data quality issues.

▪ National level analysis: analyze national scores over time and highlight critical measures for improvement.

▪ State level analysis: review state level data and pinpoint areas with high and low scores.

▪ Response rate analysis: evaluate the impact of response rates over time.

▪ Design data visualizations: create informative and user-friendly dashboard with Tableau to convey insights.

▪ Summary and Recommendations: summarize key findings and provide recommendations for improving patient satisfaction.
